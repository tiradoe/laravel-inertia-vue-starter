# Laravel Starter
Quickly get setup with Laravel using [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sail) with [TailWind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), and the [webpack-livereload-plugin](https://laravel-mix.com/docs/6.0/livereload)

Run `./setup.sh --initial` to start the application and install dependencies.

Note: only run the setup script with `--initial` once or you  may lose some changes.
